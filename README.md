## Feature / Usage

* The users will first see the instruction screen.
* Clicking on the 'Start Quiz' button will start the quiz and timer.
* Selecting the wrong answers will deducts 10 seconds from the timer.
* Scores are the result of the remaining time after completion or time expiration.
* User scores are recorded to a ranking system (still in progress).
